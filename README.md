# Dissertation software: Interactive Friend

As part of my Masters dissertation, I proposed to design an 'Interactive Friend', an animation character that engages in dialogue and conversation with users, especially for those with autism. The goal is to improve eye contact by using the webcam and machine learning algorithms along with pre-trained models are used to process users face per frame to detect the pupils then the direction they are looking at. This utilises mathematical calculations and a judgement is made. A traffic light system is used to indicate **green** if eye contact is being made, and **red** if no eye contact is being made.
